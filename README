selscan is an implementation of some haplotype based scans for selection including iHS and XP-EHH.

A typical iHS scan would be run something like:

./selscan --ihs --alt --hap <haplotypes> --map <mapfile> --out <outfile>

Other options are below, currently listed without much explanation.  Some options have not been tested, but iHS and XPEHH are working correctly.

--alt <bool> If --ihs is set, this flag will calculate the exact homozygosity of the sample instead of using allele frequencies.
	If --sumsq or --sqsum or --sumfreq is set, this flag will change ratio from H_c/H to H_c/(H_r + 1).

--cutoff <double> The EHH decay cutoff.

--filter <double> If a site has a MAF below this value, the program will not use it as a core snp.

--gap-scale <int> Gap scale parameter.  If a gap is encountered between two snps > GAP_SCALE and < MAX_GAP, then the genetic distance is scaled by GAP_SCALE/GAP.

--garud <bool> Set this flag to calculate the Garud et al. statistic.

--hap <string> A hapfile with one row per individual, and one column per variant.  Variants should be coded 0/1/-9.

--hapfreq <double> The rare haplotype frequency cutoff.

--help <bool> Prints this help dialog.

--ihp <bool> Set this flag to calculate iHP.

--ihs <bool> Set this flag to calculate iHS.

--map <string> A mapfile with one row per variant site.  Formatted <chr#> <locusID> <genetic pos> <physical pos>.

--max-gap <int> Maximum allowed gap between two snps.

--out <string> The basename for all output files.

--query <string> Query a specific locus instead of scanning the whole dataset.

--qwin <int> The length of the query window in each direction from the query locus.

--ref <string> A hapfile with one row per individual, and one column per variant.  Variants should be coded 0/1/-9. This is the reference population for XP-EHH
 calculations.  Ignored otherwise.

--sqsum <bool> Set this flag to calculate the square of the summed allele frequencies * ratio.

--sumfreq <bool> Set this flag to calculate the sum of the allele frequencies * ratio.

--sumsq <bool> Set this flag to calculate the sum of squared allele frequencies * ratio.

--threads <int> The number of threads to spawn during the calculation.  Partitions locus calculations across threads.

--xpehh <bool> Set this flag to calculate XP-EHH.
