To install the binaries, just place them somewhere in your $PATH.

To compile:

make selscan 

ought to work on *nix systems.  


To compile on Windows, you'll have to procure a 
Windows version of the pthreads library.  I've had success building within the
MinGW environment and using the pthreads-win32 library.


The program norm depends on GSL.  The libraries included on GitHub are 
compiled for OSX.  If you wish to compile norm on other systems, you'll have to 
procure a GSL installation for your system (<http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>).
