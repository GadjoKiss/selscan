To install the binaries, just place them somewhere in your $PATH.

selscan depends on the pthread library, which should be available by default
in any build environment on a *nix system.  On Windows, I have had success
building selscan using pthreads-win32 (http://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/)
and compiling in a MinGW environment (http://www.mingw.org/). I have provided
a compiled version of the pthreads-win32 library in lib/pthreads-win32/.

To build (some lines in the Makefile may need to be commented/uncommented):

make selscan 

The program norm depends on GNU GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). Individual
libraries compiled for OSX, Linux, and Windows are provided in lib/osx/, lib/linux, 
lib/win32.

To build (some lines in the Makefile may need to be commented/uncommented):

make norm
